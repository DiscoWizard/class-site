  <p> ☆ Hello, I'm Alexis! ☆ </p>
  <p>I’m a Graphic Design major at VCUarts and the VCU Honors College, branching into human-centered & visual design. I have a wealth of experience and have worn a couple different hats from print designer, freelance artist, illustrator, to web designer! And while I have spread my wings, I’ve always pushed towards success. I’m a WorldSkills USA National Champion for Graphic Design Technology, and my freelance designs have been bought by local and national organizations.</p>

  <p>Outside of work I love experimental web, video games, and science fiction (right now I’m halfway through my Next Generation rewatch). I’ve written <a style="text-decoration:none;" href="https://pgenpod.com/pgenzine/2020/5/8/postproduction-in-homestuck-and-beyond-examined-as-designed"> a guest article for examining design in fandom space</a>, and have been <a style="text-decoration:none;" href="https://www.dbltap.com/posts/visual-novel-validate-tells-stories-most-games-ignore-01ecx7myyp7d"> interviewed by DBLTAP about diversity in the visual novel genre</a>. I’m also part of the SpicyYeti coding community for introducing artists to building their own websites, as well as focusing on accessible and inclusive design practice.</p>
