Little parcels of micro. 🔗 Soares figure that they were pointed also get some point needles and wash them 🔗 and you basically put see your macro the flesh of the mackerel in just lots of 🔗 point needles 🔗 and then just wrap it in paper there in time for the barbecue to get really nice 🔗 foresty After got so similar are been using. 🔗 One of our cherry apple. 🔗 I think the other one I use yet then I send the usenet with what I was going to 🔗 cook with the cinnamon 🔗 and you sound like all these woods in water for a while then you put them in your 🔗 barbecue you get the apple in the cherry for cell phones 🔗 and a need smokes the food as well. 🔗 Yes No I sells really good dry that it is really good. I don't know. 🔗 After all and something. 🔗 Is quite Yes so it was a friend of mine who introduced me to riches. 🔗 Sean Taylor had offered and I tried one of them. 🔗 And therein lies the takeaway dishes. 🔗 Yeah they're not in the takeaway dish 🔗 and you so come in then just leave him in a girl was 🔗 and tell you put him in your barbecue 🔗 and the zero most beautiful Yeah sounds really good is really you can really add it 🔗 to taking a class 🔗 and I mean really tried it was I mean I like doing repetitive steaks and that 🔗 but is it weird on a Friday on a decent film but a waste. 🔗 I think is to be honest I wouldn't fit on the particular I think I go for maybe at 🔗 maybe a certain Yeah laughs I really go for that but I say with the smoking 🔗 and the Romans that was something I probably said this you before something 🔗 that was always you know sort of a college was making people eat with all their 🔗 senses and just don't say the smoke or you come in for dinner. 🔗 That's that's got you ready to eat it. Way. 🔗 It's like the fresh baking bread when you're going to health. 🔗 That's right and the fresh coffee just makes you go right and ready to eat. 🔗 You know even if you weren't hungry two minutes ago you soon will be. Like. 🔗 There's lots of expenses and also I mean again going back to the barbecue. 🔗 I like doing vegetables on the barbecue. 🔗 Yeah I actually bought one of those baskets full of old 🔗 and I put them all in there and keeps them and so I don't put all those in 🔗 and I just like just just roasted that's a good wage cause 🔗 that you know preteens you know. Yeah really nice fresh fruit. Yet it's good clean. 🔗 That's all that's really good. I think because you know where it's come from. 🔗 You know I some fresh. 🔗 Yeah barbecue top here because we had Bob He just actually there on the beach. 🔗 How would happen how would I would change focus 🔗 and do a lot sterner barbecue what would you do. 🔗 How to do a lobster on a barbecue probably just cut it straight down a little. 🔗 But if you got some garlic butter keep it really simple. 🔗 I think lobster and crab for that matter. 🔗 Best serve really simple keep from cream flavors. 🔗 So maybe new potatoes green salad and lobster with some call it 🔗 and it's really simple 🔗 but I think it needs to be overcomplicated kind of talk for itself. 🔗 Maybe if you wanted to do something different. Get tight flavors I guess. Yeah. 🔗 Chili go and go moose and some ginger and then to turn that into butter 🔗 or something. Possibly you just mentioned garlic and put in boxes those nice. 🔗 Yeah really nice on 🔗 that you know this always just like whatever you want just chop them really finally 🔗 put them in a blender and then that you butter. 🔗 Turn it into so and there's wrapping and going from top in the freezer 🔗 and it's sadly that's just I've got one of my my big flat hand up to date 🔗 and I did some games we bought are in buggy this is. And when I stop in there. 🔗 I did just a small cup of one in there as well. 🔗 Lots of seasoning and then I put this collapse in 🔗 and squeeze the lemons lovely just free form and it's volcanic 🔗 and turn him over after beautiful seating and he.

Yeah it's on like I call them the cake to the planks. 🔗 Yet I feel he can do all that. 🔗 Yeah yeah I mean really I think the basic The idea is just really not whatever 🔗 people want but you know he likes a flexible catering You know if you really are. 🔗 If people want me to just deliver a buffet 🔗 and they want to the sandwiches that's fine if people want a dinner party 🔗 and they want to look after the to dessert for instance 🔗 and leave me with the starter the main course that's that's fine as well is this 🔗 flexible.
