<p>This article is definitely the thesis of this class. In highschool I had to make websites for various things and portfolios, and because I didn’t have any coding knowledge, I used sites like wix and weebly to set them up. I remember being frustrated with the limitations of using an interface to move the parts around and only be able to add and edit what the site itself thought that I would need. Later on when I had a tumblr blog I started to occasionally go into the html to copy paste custom themes and follow step guides to make specific changes. A lot of the time I still had no idea what I was doing, and would occasionally just delete areas of code to see what happened (with varying results). That personality buggy edited code and the ability to completely do whatever I wanted with my site,even making it in such a way that you couldn’t even read my posts, which I thought (and still think) was hilarious, is what I miss most from that site. Now with most people moved to twitter and instagram, everything is streamlined and flat and does everything to make every part of the site and profiles as consistent and corporate as possible.
</p>
<p>With every edit I make to my static site I have to open atom, save the changes, open git, update it, push it, and wait for it to load. And it’s fantastic. There’s a different level of thought and intention, even with personal and knowledgeable limitations, to building a place where everything is made by hand. Every update is pushed and every image and page is done by a person who wanted it there and went through the effort to make sure it was there. Even with sites like neocities and other ones where you code it in browser, it’s still such an individual place.

<p>I’ve always really like Le Guin’s work, from when I had to read her Omelas piece in high school. Her writing has a consistent delicate flavor to it, saying exactly what she means while still keeping a thoughtful energy to it that makes you think more about what she’s saying, and take the multiple levels of her meaning in. In this article it’s no different, and I agree with what she says. Things like “hard” sci-fi and “soft” sci-fi have always been used to lift the ‘hard’, tech heavy bits of it and disregard the ‘soft’ and human parts of it. The “future” parts of it don’t reach out and slap you in the face, so they’re weak for simply inviting you in to think about the world the story is in. And with it, placing a hierarchy on what is ‘important’ science, and what is less relevant to society and to the concept and the creation of a future.
</p>
<p>Also, to be honest, it kind of reminds me how people differentiate between other fields, especially in those that have certain amounts of prestige attached to them. There have to be differentiators to say that if following certain rules or sticking to certain topics, are better or more important, more “hard,” than another. The most common example being hard sciences versus soft sciences. Hard sciences are the sciences where there’s more math, or at least perceived so, such as physics or chemistry. How the ‘important’ things work in life. The soft sciences being things like biology, environments, and psychology and sociology. How living things work in a system, and how these systems affect each other. There’s different optics with each group, how they are thought of academically, and how seriously they are taken. I think it is also relevant to note that the soft sciences are generally those science fields where there are more women, and harder ones where there are more men, and those attributes and perceptions carry over.
