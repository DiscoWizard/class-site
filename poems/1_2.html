<p>
Just got to the airport <br> and I don't know where to go <br>
Can you show me the way <br> to Humphrey terminal?<br>
Keep the kryptonite <br> in your pocket, <br> okay, bro<br>
Cause the doctor don't know <br> why my heart rate won't slow<br>
And I'm spinning in slow motion <br> like a ballerina<br>
On top <br> of a kid's <br> jewelry box <br> when it's about to stop<br>
</p>
<p>
Bought a kryptonite baggie<br>
And a science magazine <br> with a yeti on the cover<br>
Mitigating insecurity <br> before the worry
Turn the skin a pretty guava color<br>
Water bottle gum; <br> bobbleheaded<br>
Waiting for a code <br> from the television<br>
Wrong terminal, <br> wrong concourse<br>
Wrong gate, <br> wrong A-27<br>
</p>
<p>
I'm spinning in fast motion <br> like <br> a motorcycle inside<br>
Of a cage sphere of death <br> when it's about to shred<br>
</p>
<p>
And I'm spinning in slow motion like <br> a ballerina<br>
On top <br> of a kid's <br> jewelry box <br> when it's about to stop<br>
</p>
