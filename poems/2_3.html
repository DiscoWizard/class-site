<p>
Just got to the <big> airport </big> and I don't know where to <big> go </big> <br>
Can you show me the <big> way </big> to Humphrey <big> terminal? </big> <br>
Keep the kryptonite <big> in </big> your pocket, okay, <big> bro </big><br>
Cause the doctor don't <big> know </big> why my heart rate won't <big>slow</big><br>
<big> And I'm spinning in slow motion like a ballerina<br>
On top of a kid's jewelry box when it's about to stop<br> </big>
</p>
<p>
<small>Bought a kryptonite</small> baggie<br>
<small>And a science</small> magazine <small>with a yeti on the cover</small><br>
<small> Mitigating insecurity before the worry<br>
Turn the skin a pretty guava color<br>
Water bottle gum; bobbleheaded<br>
Waiting for </small> code <small>from the television</small><br>
<small>Wrong</small> terminal, <small>wrong</small> concourse<br>
Wrong <big>gate</big>, wrong <big>A-27</big><br>
</p>
<p>
<small>I'm spinning in fast motion</small> like a motorcycle inside<br>
<big>Of a cage sphere of death when it's about to shred<br> </big>
</p>
<p>
<small>And I'm spinning in slow motion</small> like a ballerina<br>
<big>On top of a kid's jewelry box when it's about to stop<br> </big>
