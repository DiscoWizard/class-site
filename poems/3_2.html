Just got to the airport and I don't know where to go <br>
Can you show me the way to Humphrey terminal?<br>
Keep the kryptonite in your pocket, okay, bro<br>
Cause the doctor don't know why my heart rate won't slow<br>
And I'm spinning in slow motion like a ballerina<br>
On top of a kid's jewelry box when it's about to stop<br>
</p>
<p class="divb">
Bought a kryptonite baggie<br>
And a science magazine with a yeti on the cover<br>
Mitigating insecurity before the worry<br>
Turn the skin a pretty guava color<br>
Water bottle gum; bobbleheaded<br>
Waiting for a code from the television<br>
Wrong terminal, wrong concourse<br>
Wrong gate, wrong A-27
</p>
<p class="diva">
I'm spinning in fast motion like a motorcycle inside<br>
Of a cage sphere of death when it's about to shred<br>
</p>
<br>
<p>
And I'm spinning in slow motion like a ballerina<br>
On top of a kid's jewelry box when it's about to stop<br>
