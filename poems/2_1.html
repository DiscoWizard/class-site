<strong> <em>Just got to the airport and I don't know where to go </strong> </em><br>
Can you show me the way to <strong> Humphrey </strong> terminal?<br>
Keep the <em> kryptonite </em> in your pocket, okay, bro<br>
Cause the doctor don't know why my <strong> heart rate </strong> won't slow<br>
And I'm spinning in slow motion like a <em> ballerina </em> <br>
On top of a kid's jewelry box when it's about to <strong>stop</strong><br>
</p>
<p>
Bought a <em> kryptonite </em> baggie<br>
And a science magazine with a <strong> yeti </strong> on the cover<br>
Mitigating <em> insecurity </em> before the worry<br>
Turn the skin a pretty <strong> guava </strong> color<br>
Water bottle gum; <em> bobbleheaded </em> <br>
Waiting for a code from the <strong>television</strong>
<li> Wrong terminal, <br>
<li> wrong concourse<br>
<li> Wrong gate, <br>
<li> wrong A-27<br>

</p>
<p>
  <ol>
<li>I'm spinning in fast motion like a motorcycle inside<br>
<li>Of a cage sphere of death when it's about to shred<br>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
  <ol>
<li>And I'm spinning in slow motion like a ballerina<br>
<li>On top of a kid's jewelry box when it's about to stop<br>
</ol>
