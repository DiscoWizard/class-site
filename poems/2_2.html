Just got to the airport and I don't know where to go <br> </h6>

Can you show me the way to  Humphrey terminal?<br> </h5>
<h4>
Keep the  kryptonite  in your pocket, okay, bro<br> </h4>

Cause the doctor don't know why my  heart rate  won't slow<br> </h3>

And I'm spinning in slow motion like a  ballerina  <br> </h2>

Mitigating  insecurity  before the worry<br> </h4>
